This is the final project from Master 1 semester 1 POO class. 
The aim was to code a Domino game and a Carcassonne game, and to implement both of the games in a dynamic UI.

To play the games you need to:
  - download the Game.tar file
  - locate yourself in the directory where you dowloaded the Game.tar file
  - run the following command to compile the code:
      - **tar xvf Game.tar && cd src && javac \*.java**
  - run the following command to start the game with the UI:
      - **java MainTest dynamicUI**
  - run the following command to start a domino game in command line:
      - **java MainTest commandlines**
